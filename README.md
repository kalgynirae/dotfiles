Colin Chan's dotfiles.

IMPORTANT: There is absolutely no guarantee that these work outside of Colin's
specific machine. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

I don't recommend you actually install these unless you are Colin. Instead, look
at them for inspiration, or take specific bits and pieces that you understand.

```bash
# Install the packages (not automated yet except for Arch)
./install

# Install mustache
mkdir -p ~/.gem/bin
gem install mustache

# Install again to render the templates
./install
```

Get back to work! Go check the electric fence or something! -- Edna Mode
What is it? Who are you? What do you want? -- Edna Mode
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in! Come, come. -- Edna Mode
Yes, things are going quite well. Quite well. My God, no complaints. But, you know, it is not the same. Not the same at all. -- Edna Mode
Supermodels. Ha! Nothing super about them. Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures with poofy lips who think only about themselves. Feh! I used to design for gods. -- Edna Mode
But perhaps you come with a challenge, eh? I was surprised to get your call. -- Edna Mode
Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very sturdy. And you've torn right through it! -- Edna Mode
What have you been doing, Robert? Moonlighting hero work? -- Edna Mode
This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in this. I won't allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? -- Edna Mode
I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. -- Edna Mode
You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy. So ask me now, before I again become sane. -- Edna Mode
You push too hard, darling! But I accept. -- Edna Mode
It will be bold. Dramatic! Heroic! -- Edna Mode
No capes! -- Edna Mode
Darling! It's been such a long time after all these years! So long! -- Edna Mode
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it? Much better than those horrible pajamas he used to wear. -- Edna Mode
You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye. -- Edna Mode
My best work, I must admit. Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die. -- Edna Mode
Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble! Too much of it, darling. Too much! -- Edna Mode
Edna Mode. And guest. -- Edna Mode
Shh! Darling! Shh! -- Edna Mode
And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature. -- Edna Mode
No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. -- Edna Mode
What are you talking about? You are Elastigirl! My God! Pull yourself together! What will you do? Is this a question? You will show him you remember that he is Mr. Incredible, and you will remind him who you are! Well, you know where he is. Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win! And call me when you get back, darling. I enjoy our visits. -- Edna Mode

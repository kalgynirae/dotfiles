But perhaps you come with a challenge, // eh? I was surprised to get your call. // Edna Mode
Hmm. This is megamesh. Outmoded, but very // sturdy. And you've torn right through it! // Edna Mode
This is a hobo suit, darling. You can't be seen in this. // I won't allow it! Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now? // Edna Mode
I never look back, darling. It distracts from the now. // Edna Mode
You can't! It's impossible! I'm far too busy. // So ask me now, before I again become sane. // Edna Mode
You push too hard, darling! But I accept. // Edna Mode
It will be bold. Dramatic! Heroic! // Edna Mode
No capes! // Edna Mode
Darling! It's been such a long time after all these years! So long! // Edna Mode
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it? Much better // than those horrible pajamas he used to wear. // Edna Mode
You come in one hour, darling. I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye. // Edna Mode
My best work, I must admit. Simple, // elegant, yet bold. You will die. // Edna Mode
Yes, words are useless. Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, // gobble! Too much of it, darling. Too much! // Edna Mode
And machine washable, darling. That's a new feature. // Edna Mode
No? Well, he'll look fabulous anyway. // Edna Mode
Imagine the most horrible, terrifying, evil thing // you can possibly think of, and multiply it... by six. // Megamind
Look, I wouldn't stay here for more than two // minutes and thirty-seven seconds if I were you. // We're having the walls and ceiling removed. // Bernard
Love with your heart; use your head for everything else. // Captain Disillusion
When did all the windmills start to turn so slow? // bill wurtz
How could I be so easily defeateeeeeeeeed!? // Heats Flamesman
It always fits. Eventually. // Stan
